# Web-Scraping
The objective of this project is to collect relevant used car data from the Cars24 website, 
specifically for the Chennai region. The data includes car model, kilometers driven, year of 
manufacture, fuel type, transmission, and price. This dataset will be used for further 
analysis using Power BI to derive insights on pricing trends, usage patterns, and popular 
fuel types.
